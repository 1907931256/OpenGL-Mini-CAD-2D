-> INPUT CONTROLS
        * W,A,S,D - move in 3d world space
        * MOUSE BUTTON 2 - move camera

        * KEY E : Select Edit Mode (works only if there is no model under processing:
            F was pressed before E)
        * KEY C : Select Creatie Mode

        * KEY R : Reset screen, clear draws

    CREATIVE MODE

        * KEY 0 : Select no curve type to be drawn on the screeen
        * KEY 1 : HERMITE curve
        * KEY 2 : BEZIER curve
        * KEY 3 : B-SPLINE curve
        * KEY 4 : SPLINE curve
        * KEY 5 : NURB curve
        * KEY 6 : BEZIER surface
        * KEY 7 : SPLINE surface
        * KEY 8 : NURB surface

        * KEY F : Finish processing the current model
        * KEY Z : Select Translation for curve expansion
        * KEY X : Select Y Rotation for curve expansion

        * KEY I : Print info about the current state on console

        * KEY -> : Increase the Curves No
        * KEY <- : Decrease the Curves No

        * MOUSE SCROOL UP   : Increase the Number of Curve Points
        * MOUSE SCROOL DOWN : Decrease the Number of Curve Points
        * MOUSE BUTTON 1    : Set a point on the screen

        ACTIONS

            * press KEY F -> Set cursor on a point -> press MOUSE BUTTON 1 :
                Set the model to which the point belongs, to current model - 
                further processing can be done.

            * Basic usage:
                1) Select a curve or a surface to generate with KEYS from 1 to 8
                2) Set cursor on different places on the screen and press MOUSE BUTTON 1
                to generate a point
                3) Select translation, modify the number of curves points, modify curves no
                4) press F to finish with the current model
                5) press C to enter in creative mode
                6) play with control points
                7) press R to reset

                ! Reset when you want to clear the entire screen, step 7 is optional. You can draw
                many curves at the same time on the screen.

    EDIT MODE

        * MOUSE BUTTON 1                  : Select a point on the screen
        * MOUSE BUTTON 1 axis HOLD & DRAG : Modify point position
